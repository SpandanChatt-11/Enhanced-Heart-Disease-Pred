# Enhanced-Heart-Disease-Pred
Heart disease continues to be one of the primary causes of death worldwide, with a need for proper and efficient prediction models in the early stages to ensure proper intervention. In this study, prior work has been improved on by applying standard machine learning algorithms— Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—to heart disease prediction. An extensive analysis of existing studies was conducted to evaluate their methodologies, followed by a performance comparison using the same models. Moreover, this work combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation to increase model robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SVM outperformed the other models, with an accuracy of 86%, which is better compared to the performance discussed in existing research. This study emphasizes the significance of feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and cross-validation methods in enhancing predictive performance. The results add important insights to the use of machine learning for healthcare, favoring the development of more robust and effective diagnostic devices for predicting heart disease.
